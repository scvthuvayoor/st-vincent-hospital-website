                    <h3>Our History</h3>
                    <p>St Vincent’s hospital at thuvayoor is a 40 bedded NABH entry level Hospital. It is situated in a rural area of Pathanamthitta district of South Kerala. The Pioneers (Sisters of charity of St Vincents De Paul SCV) arrived from Germany in 1974.They selected this backward rural village for their service. The hospital started with 16 beds in an emergency base. The general medicine, Genecology, Pediatrics, Surgery and ENT department worked efficiently. St vincents hospital blessed by Rt. Rev. Gregorious Bishop Of Trivandrum and inaugurated by honourable former health minister Chittaranjan on 2nd May 1978.
The psychiatry department was started in 1980 because there was no access to treatment for mental illness in this area and to prioritize the needs of the people. The first floor was built in 1984 due to the increasing number of in-patients and the shortage of space. During the corona pandemic departments except general medicine and psychiatry had to be closed.
The hospital is providing in-patients facility and outpatient consultation for the psychiatric patients. It has a rich pool of qualified, skilled and dedicated team of medical, paramedical and nursing personnel whose motto is “ Merciful love conquers the world “. Most specialized treatment is provided to the psychiatric patients especially thoser healing from the lower and middle income families at affordable rates.
